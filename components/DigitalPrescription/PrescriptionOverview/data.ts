      name: "How the Drug Works",
      content: `
        Calpol 500 contains Paracetamol, which works by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins in the brain. 
        Prostaglandins are chemicals that promote inflammation, pain, and fever. By blocking these chemicals, 
        Paracetamol reduces the intensity of pain signals sent to the brain and helps lower fever.
        It doesn't have significant anti-inflammatory properties like NSAIDs but is effective in relieving pain 
        and fever with fewer gastrointestinal side effects.
