  },
  {
    question: "What are the limitations of BMI?",
    answer:
      "BMI does not differentiate between muscle and fat mass, so it may inaccurately categorize muscular individuals as overweight or obese. It also does not account for factors like age, sex, ethnicity, and body composition.",
  },
  {
    question: "How accurate is BMI in assessing body fat?",
    answer:
